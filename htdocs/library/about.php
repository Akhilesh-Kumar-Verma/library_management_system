				DTU(Formerly DCE) was established in 1941 and
				is a primier technical institute ranked 7 in
				india, its Library System consists of a Central
				Library and 15 departmental libraries which
				collectively support the teaching, research and
				extension programmes of the Institute. All
				students, faculty members and employees of the
				Institute are entitled to make use of the Library
				facilities on taking library membership. The
				Library, besides having a huge collection of
				books on engineering, science and humanities
				offers library services through its various
				divisions. Initially setup in 1941, the Central
				Library moved to its new building in May, 2004.
				To make the Delhi College of Engineering Library
				a 21st century Knowledge Centre and to facilitate
				the transition of today\'s engineering society to
				a knowledge base society of tomorrow, the knowledge
				generated by the faculty and students of DTU has
				been digitized and made accessible through Intranet
				or Internet. Along with the automation of library
				services, we have moved towards the digitization
				of library resources, so that the services of
				Virtual Library and Knowledge Centre may be provided
				parallel with the Traditional Library.
